                        <p>This "Privacy Policy" describes how FretBay treats your personal data.

                        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with any changes taking effect 15 days after the update.

                        <p>FretBay places great importance on the confidentiality of personal data provided by its users. Under no circumstances will this information be disclosed or transferred to third parties. Exceptionally, we transmit your following personal data; surname and first name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, to the carrier from whom you have accepted a quote on the FretBay website. This information is, in fact, necessary to ensure that the transaction runs smoothly and to improve the services offered by FretBay to its members. Also the services in charge of control (in particular the auditor) and our subcontractors will have access to your personal data. Your personal data may also be passed on to judicial officers, legal officers and public bodies, exclusively to meet our legal obligations</p>

                        <p>You can browse the FretBay site without giving us any personal information about yourself. Nevertheless, when you register as a member (carrier or shipper), and when you accept an offer from a carrier, you are asked to fill in mandatory fields with your personal data: surname, first name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, contact details. These details are necessary for us to contact you, but also to allow contact between you and the carrier you have selected</p>
                        <p>In addition, when you register on FretBay as a carrier member, certain commercial information is requested from you, such as the legal and commercial name of your company, your Siret and VAT number, as well as proof of the legal practice of your company (a duplicate of your transport licence is required at the time of your registration, so that FretBay can ensure that you are exercising the profession of carrier in all legality). Some of this information will be visible to shippers who will accept your quotes.</p>

                            <p>Your e-mail address and telephone number may be used by FretBay to facilitate the services you request from the platform.

If you do not wish to receive them, simply contact us by clicking on the 'contact' link on the home page</p>
                            <p>We may also process your personal data in order to facilitate your access to certain services accessible on the platform, to build up a file of registered users, customers and prospects, and to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations</p>
                            <p>The above provisions, which are the subject of a declaration to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert√©s, do not prevent the assignment or transfer of all or part of FretBay's activities to one or more third parties. In accordance with articles 38 and 39 of the French Data Protection Act of January 6th 1978, amended in August 2004, you have the right to access and rectify any information concerning you.

In the absence of instructions given by the person during his or her lifetime, the heirs will be able to exercise certain rights such as the right of access, if necessary for the settlement of the deceased's estate, or the right to object to the closure of the deceased's user accounts and to object to the processing of their data</p>
