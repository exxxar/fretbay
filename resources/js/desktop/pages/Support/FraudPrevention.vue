                        <p>FretBay protects you against fraud and scams by systematically checking carriers before
                            approving them on the site. Indeed, carriers are only validated after having <strong>received
                                the</strong> legal documents of their company: Kbis, transport licence and their
                            identity. It is only after this check that carriers are entitled to carry out <strong>deliveries</strong>
                            on FretBay. In addition, a dedicated dispute resolution service has been set up.</p>
                        <p>As a result, users are scrupulously protected. Nevertheless, there are still some carriers
                            <strong>on dubious websites</strong>, that prevent the protection of customers 100% against
                            fraud. FretBay has put in place some tips to protect you as well as possible.</p>
                        <h2>Differentiate between fraud and litigation</h2>
                        <p>Indeed, a dispute is the expression of a dispute between two minimum parties which must be
                            submitted to a court for a decision, whereas fraud is an dishonest act done with the
                            intention of deceiving.</p>
                        <p>If a dispute arises with your carrier, please send us an email to <a
                            href="mailto:support@fretbay.com">support@fretbay.com</a>. All complaints must be in
                            writing, and no complaint will be accepted by telephone. A dedicated team will take care of
                            the problem and act as a mediator between you and the carrier</p>
                        <p>FretBay has observed several recurring complaints</p>
                        <ul class="list-simple">
                            <li>My carrier did not arrive with a vehicle large enough to accommodate the entire load
                            </li>
                            <li>My carrier is asking for more money than the amount announced on FretBay</li>
                            <li>My carrier does not provide me with proof of insurance for the transport of my items
                            </li>
                            <li>My carrier never came to pick up the shipment and has already been paid</li>
                            <li>My carrier did not meet the expected delivery times/was several hours late</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you encounter any of these situations, send us an email so that we can resolve the dispute
                            together.</p>
                        <h2>Common scenarios of online fraud and scams</h2>
                        <p>Fraudsters often use the same schemes to conduct their scams. That's why FretBay has gathered
                            here the recurring fraud scenarios:</p>
                        <h2>The carrier asks you to make the payment by cash transfer:</h2>
                        <p>It is good to know that you can pay a professional up to 3000â‚¬ in cash. Beyond this amount,
                            you will have to use another payment method (cheque, credit card, bank transfer...). In
                            addition, money transfers are often made through Western Union or Moneygram. These sites are
                            not suitable for this type of payment because the money is not tracked and is therefore not
                            refundable. Fraudsters using this type of payment often claim the amount of money before the
                            service is delivered.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to refuse or cancel the service if you do not feel comfortable with the service
                            provider. Contact our customer service at or send an email to <a
                                href="mailto:support@fretbay.com">support@fretbay.com</a> if you have any doubt...</p>
                        <p>To protect yourself from this type of fraud, pay for the services with a secure payment
                            method: by credit card, Paypal account, cash up to 3000 euros, bank transfer. It should be
                            noted that FretBay partner transport and removal companies are small SMEs, VSEs, etc. and do
                            not always have the credit card payment device, which is why they can require cash payment.
                            In addition, payments by cheque are no longer always appreciated due to a large number of
                            frauds.</p>
                        <h2>You receive an advertising type email announcing that FretBay has items that you have just
                            purchased online, or that FretBay has a facility to store the same items</h2>
                        <p>This type of message is common when you buy a large item or a car/motorcycle on a classified
                            ad site. The author of the message will tell you that FretBay is in possession of the item
                            just purchased. Fraudsters try, by sending this message, to impersonate the company in order
                            to steal your bank or personal information. To do this, scammers manufacture and send you
                            invoices and information about false loads. To be sure that the email is sent by FretBay,
                            look at the sender's address. All emails sent by FretBay have the domain name @fretbay.com.
                            If the email is not sent from FretBay, do not reply to it as authors often request cash
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>Be aware that FretBay is never in possession of your items: only the movers have them.</p>
                        <p>If you receive emails that seem unreliable to you, feel free to contact us at or to <a
                            href="mailto:support@fretbay.com">support@fretbay.com</a></p>
                        <h2>You booked and paid for the transport before the service but since then you have had no
                            news</h2>
                        <p>Even if FretBay leaves the choice of payment to the carriers, some ask for a deposit or full
                            payment of the invoice before the service is provided. If you are in this situation, do not
                            pay through cash transfers (see above).</p>
                        <p>If you ever want to cancel the service because you are no longer confident, contact our

                        <h2>The carrier is on his way with the load but does not seem to want to deliver it</h2>
                        <p>If the carrier has loaded your goods and you suspect him, try to contact him. If you are sure
                            that the carrier does not intend to deliver your goods to you, contact customer service
                            quickly at Also contact the police to take the necessary measures for a conventional
                            robbery.</p>
