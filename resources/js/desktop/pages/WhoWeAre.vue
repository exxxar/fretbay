                <h2>The company</h2>
                <p>FretBay was created to meet the objective of its designers: to create an innovative market platform
                    for individuals, providing an economical and ecological response to the occasional transport needs
                    of bulky goods, for example for a private move, the transport of motorcycles, cars, furniture,
                    household appliances, animals and many other things</p>
                <p>FretBay is convinced that a better vehicle load factor and a better distribution of road freight not
                    only provides economic but also environmental benefits!</p>
                <p>FretBay, because we all have a common road...</p>
